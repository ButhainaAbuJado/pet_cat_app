        "Signs of Fractures Cats are independent creatures, and they can have a high tolerance for pain. Sometimes, this combination of personality traits can mean a broken bone goes unnoticed. However, you can look for several symptoms that will indicate the presence of a fracture: Changes in gait. Your cat might avoid putting weight on one leg. This could mean the leg is broken or that another bone in the area is making walking on that part of the body more painful.Restricted movement. Cats normally have excellent mobility. The curl up to groom themselves, jump easily, and stretch out to sharpen their claws. These movements would be impossible or very painful if your cat has a broken bone. If you see that your cat is reluctant to move, you might investigate further.Changes in usual behavior. Your cat will have patterns of behavior that are familiar to you. If, for example, your cat always has a healthy appetite but is now avoiding food, you need to find out why; a broken jaw might prevent your cat from wanting to chew food.Vocalization. Some cats might suffer in silence, but others will meow more often, or they might moan or cry. Some cats might also hide away in order to avoid further interaction that could cause pain.Swelling. Broken bones cause inflammation. If you see noticeable swelling on the legs, body, or tail (tails can break too), make sure you see the vet.As you assess these symptoms, try to keep your cat hydrated until you can see a vet. Avoiding food and drink is common animal behavior after becoming injured.Handling Your Cat When checking your cat for possible fractures, always be as gentle as possible. Try not to move your cat if possible. Help your pet cope with the injury by keeping children and other playful pets away from your cat. Too much movement or harsh handling can make injuries worse or increase your cat's pain.If the bone has broken the skin, don't try to push bones back in or do any other home treatments. Instead, keep your cat as still as possible and cover the open area with clean gauze. See your vet as soon as possible for these more serious fractures.If your cat is too wiggly or tries to run instead of being touched, you can carefully wrap your cat in a small blanket and place them on a board or another flat surface to make them safer to carry. You might even gently tie your cat down to keep them from moving.Treatment Your vet will assess the injury and stabilize the bone. Simple breaks can sometimes be set with a splint, but many cats actually require surgery in order to fully repair broken bones. The break might need a screw, surgical pins, or even plates in order to keep the disparate bone pieces in place as they heal.If your cat has injured their spine, hips, or pelvis, the treatment plan can be even more extensive, requiring full-body movement restriction until the break has healed.In some cases, breaks are too severe to set with splints or surgery. Your vet might recommend amputation as the most humane course of treatment. Cats can learn to live without a portion of their tail and change their movements to accommodate the loss of a leg.",

        "Having kittens is an exciting and emotional time. Before you can experience the joy of welcoming newborn kittens into your home, you have to know how to tell if your cat is pregnant, how long a cat gestation period is and what you can do to ensure their pregnancy is as happy as possible. It’s important to remember your cat and their litter will have needs they’ll depend on you to fulfill. To help support your cat throughout their pregnancy and labor, we’ve gathered some helpful information you should know about expectant cats. Cat Pregnancy Much like people, cats have periods of peak fertility when they are most likely to become pregnant, known as being “in season” or “in heat.” Cats can begin these cycles as early as four to five months of age and they occur about once every three weeks, giving them lots of opportunities to get pregnant. If you’re looking to avoid an unexpected litter of kittens, you may want to speak to your veterinarian about neutering your cat when she’s young. By their first season, they will be fully capable of getting pregnant. Bringing up an unplanned litter of kittens can be stressful and expensive. This being the case, breeding kittens should be left to experts or individuals well prepared in advance for the task. How Long Do Cats Stay Pregnant? The typical cat gestation period can last 62 to 65 days. Your cat often won’t show any physical symptoms of pregnancy until they are a few weeks into their term. If you think your cat is pregnant, take them to the veterinarian for confirmation. How to Tell if Your Cat Is Pregnant While you should always get a professional opinion, here are signs to look for if you suspect your cat may be pregnant:After approximately 15 to 18 days of cat pregnancies, you may notice that their nipples have become enlarged and red, commonly referred to as “pinking up.” Your cat may go through a stage of vomiting, similar to morning sickness in humans. If you notice their sickness becoming more frequent or they seem unwell in any other way, contact your veterinarian.Your cat’s belly will start to swell, but it’s essential to avoid touching it, so you don’t risk harming your cat or her unborn kittens. There can be other causes of abdominal swelling, so monitor your cat closely for any signs of illness and consult your veterinarian if you have any concerns.An expecting cat will gain between one to two kilograms (depending on the number of kittens they are carrying).

        "As the summer months arrive and their inevitable heatwaves hit, remembering that our feline companions feel the heat as much—if not more—than we do can be vitally important. It’s not only about keeping your cat comfortable; making sure your cat is protected from the heat can protect them from heat exhaustion and heatstroke—and potentially save their lives.  What is Heat Exhaustion vs. Heatstroke?Heatstroke is a serious condition that cats and other animals experience when their body temperature becomes so high their body cannot cool themselves. The precursor to heatstroke is heat exhaustion Signs of heat exhaustion in cats include restless behavior as they search for a cool spot or area, panting, drooling, sweaty paws or excessive grooming, which are all an effort to cool themselves down. Heat exhaustion can quickly become heatstroke if a cat doesn’t find solace from the heat. Heatstroke occurs in cats when their body temperature reaches 105°F or above. If you believe your cat is suffering from heatstroke, get your cat to a cool, well-ventilated area and call your veterinarian or emergency pet clinic immediately.  ",

        "Most experienced cat owners can pick up on what their cat is trying to tell them through years of experience. Understanding cat body language can sometimes be challenging, though, even for long-time cat enthusiasts.  That doesn’t mean cats aren’t good communicators, though. Knowing what to look for can give you good insight into your cat’s emotions and help you create a closer bond, and that’s a win for everyone. Cat Body Language Cats primarily use three types of body language to communicate how they’re feeling: their tails, posture and ears. These three indicators are often the easiest for humans to inperpretinterpret. Here’s how to read your cat’s emotions through body language.The Tail Has a Tale to Tell Fortunately, when it comes to the body language of a cat, one of the most helpful indicators is also one of a cat’s most prominent features: its tail. There are times where just by looking at which way a cat’s tail is pointing or how it’s moving, you’ll get an excellent idea if they want to play, cuddle or just want some space to themself. The meaning behind the five most common cat tail positions and movements: The question mark: Cats often position their tail in the shape of a question mark when they’re feeling playful. Time to grab a cat toy! Tail pointing straight up: This signifies a cat is feeling confident and ready to engage in some positive interaction. Tail wrapping: If a cat wraps their tail around another cat or a person, it’s a definite sign of affection, and it’s time to return the gesture by giving them a gentle scratch under the chin. A tucked away tail: This is a signal your cat might be feeling uncertain and fearful. Give them their space and evaluate what might be making your cat feel this way. A puffed-up tail: Unless it’s during play, when a cat does this, it’s either agitated or afraid. In this instance, step back, check for any stimuli that may be upsetting the cat and give them time to settle back down.    ",

        "The behavior, known as night vocalization or night calling, can be a problem if it’s a sign of discomfort or if it’s disturbing your rest. It’s widely known that cats are night owls. It seems the moment we switch off the light, they start sprinting around the house—like they have the cat version of the dog zoomies.  When they’re engaging in their nighttime antics, they may also meow a lot, too. Sometimes, your cat meowing at night can be disruptive and get in the way of you getting some much-needed rest. If your cat does this and you’re asking yourself, “why does my cat meow at night and what can I do about it?” there are some goodWhy Does My Cat Meow at Night? 1. Cats Are Naturally More Active at Night Your cat’s meowing at night may have a lot to do with the fact that they are naturally more active at certain hours of the night. Although it’s popularly thought that cats are nocturnal, this isn’t always true.Cats are crepuscular, meaning they are naturally most active at dusk and dawn. Although many cats do adapt to the routine of their owners, this crepuscular tendency means your cat may be especially active in the early hours of the morning, when the rest of the house is asleep.Younger cats have an increased tendency to be active at night, as their instincts tell them this is a great time to hunt. As they mature, though, it is likely their rhythm will adapt to the rest of the household, which may hopefully mean less cat meowing at night.2. Your Cat May Be Bored or Understimulated Cat howling or crying at night may be because they’re bored or because they haven’t tired themselves out during the day. Active play before bedtime may help to ensure they are more tired at night, as will trying to keep their minds active and happy during the day.In short, cat meowing at night can essentially be attention-seeking behavior. Although it is important to attend to your cat’s needs, constantly complying with their ploys for attention will likely lead them to engage in it more frequently. If your cat is constantly seeking attention at inappropriate times, try not to give in too often.Indoor cats need ample opportunities for play and exercise throughout the day, so toys, cat towers and other items are essential. Otherwise, you may find they have a lot of pent-up energy when you’re heading off to bed.3. Overactive Thyroid or Kidney Disease If your cat is meowing at night or on a frequent basis, it’s a good idea to consult with a veterinarian to check up on their health. This is because excessive vocalization, including at night, can be a sign of overactive thyroid or kidney disease in cats. 4. A Symptom of Aging in Senior Cats Aging can affect all of us, and cats are no different. As they age, it is possible the effects of aging on the brain can leave your cat disoriented. Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome (CDS) is directly related to the effect of aging on a cat’s brain and can have a variety of symptoms, including excessive meowing at night. It’s worth seeing your veterinarian to rule out any complications.  ",
